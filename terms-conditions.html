    <h4 style="font-weight: 800;">Terms &amp; Conditions</h4> 
    <br><p>
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will
      automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
      that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
      allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
      our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
      to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
      versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
      database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
      to it, still belong to Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic.
    </p> <p>
      Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic is committed to ensuring that the app is
      as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
      reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
      its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
      charge you for the app or its services without making it very
      clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p> <p>
      The Sanjivani Developer Student Club app stores and processes personal data that
      you have provided to us, to provide our
      Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
      access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
      not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
      removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
      official operating system of your device. It could make your
      phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
      compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
      that the Sanjivani Developer Student Club app won’t work properly or at all.
    </p> <div><p>
        The app does use third-party services that declare their
        Terms and Conditions.
      </p> <p>
        Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service
        providers used by the app
      </p> 
      <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that
      Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic will not take responsibility for. Certain
      functions of the app will require the app to have an active
      internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
      by your mobile network provider, but Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic
      cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
      functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
      have any of your data allowance left.
    </p> <p></p> <p>
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
      should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
      mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
      be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
      the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
      other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
      charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
      (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
      you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
      using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
      received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    </p> <p>
      Along the same lines, Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic cannot always take
      responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
      battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
      Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic cannot accept responsibility.
    </p> <p>
      With respect to Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic’s responsibility for your
      use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
      bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
      updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
      to provide information to us so that we can make it available
      to you. Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic accepts no liability for any
      loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
      relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
    </p> <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
      currently available on  – the requirements for the 
      system(and for any additional systems we
      decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
      and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
      using the app. Sanjivani K.B.P Polytechnic does not promise that it
      will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
      and/or works with the  version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always
      accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
      also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
      it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
      Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
      rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
      (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
      from your device.
    </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
      We may update our Terms and Conditions
      from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
      periodically for any changes. We will
      notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
      Conditions on this page.
    </p> <p>
      These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-11-01
